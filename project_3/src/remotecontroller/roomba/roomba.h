  Drive Opcode: 137 Data Bytes: 4
  This command controls Roomba’s drive wheels. It takes four data bytes, interpreted as two 16-bit signed
  values using two’s complement. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) The first two bytes
  specify the average velocity of the drive wheels in millimeters per second (mm/s), with the high byte
  being sent first. The next two bytes specify the radius in millimeters at which Roomba will turn. The
  longer radii make Roomba drive straighter, while the shorter radii make Roomba turn more. The radius is
  measured from the center of the turning circle to the center of Roomba. A Drive command with a
  positive velocity and a positive radius makes Roomba drive forward while turning toward the left. A
  negative radius makes Roomba turn toward the right. Special cases for the radius make Roomba turn in
  place or drive straight, as specified below. A negative velocity makes Roomba drive backward.
  NOTE:
  Internal and environmental restrictions may prevent Roomba from accurately carrying out some drive
  commands. For example, it may not be possible for Roomba to drive at full speed in an arc with a large
  radius of curvature.
   Serial sequence: [137] [Velocity high byte] [Velocity low byte] [Radius high byte] [Radius low byte]
   Available in modes: Safe or Full

   Velocity (-500 – 500 mm/s)
   Radius (-2000 – 2000 mm)
  Special cases:
  Straight = 32768 or 32767 = 0x8000 or 0x7FFF
  Turn in place clockwise = -1 = 0xFFFF
  Turn in place counter-clockwise = 1 = 0x0001
  Example:
  To drive in reverse at a velocity of -200 mm/s while turning at a radius of 500mm, send the following
  serial byte sequence:
  [137] [255] [56] [1] [244]
  Explanation:
  Desired value  two’s complement and convert to hex  split into 2 bytes  convert to decimal
  Velocity = -200 = 0xFF38 = [0xFF] [0x38] = [255] [56]
  Radius = 500 = 0x01F4 = [0x01] [0xF4] = [1] [244]

  /**
  Song Opcode: 140 Data Bytes: 2N+2,
   where N is the number of notes in the song
  This command lets you specify up to four songs to the OI that you can play at a later time. Each song is
  associated with a song number. The Play command uses the song number to identify your song selection.
  Each song can contain up to sixteen notes. Each note is associated with a note number that uses MIDI
  note definitions and a duration that is specified in fractions of a second. The number of data bytes varies,
  depending on the length of the song specified. A one note song is specified by four data bytes. For each
  additional note within a song, add two data bytes.
   Serial sequence: [140] [Song Number] [Song Length] [Note Number 1] [Note Duration 1] [Note
  Number 2] [Note Duration 2], etc.
   Available in modes: Passive, Safe, or Full
   Changes mode to: No Change
   Song Number (0 – 4)
  The song number associated with the specific song. If you send a second Song command, using the
  same song number, the old song is overwritten.
   Song Length (1 – 16)
  The length of the song, according to the number of musical notes within the song.
   Song data bytes 3, 5, 7, etc.: Note Number (31 – 127)
  The pitch of the musical note Roomba will play, according to the MIDI note numbering scheme. The
  lowest musical note that Roomba will play is Note #31. Roomba considers all musical notes outside
  the range of 31 – 127 as rest notes, and will make no sound during the duration of those notes.
   Song data bytes 4, 6, 8, etc.: Note Duration (0 – 255)
  The duration of a musical note, in increments of 1/64th of a second. Example: a half-second long
  musical note has a duration value of 32.

  /**
  Stream Opcode: 148 Data Bytes: N + 1,
   where N is the number of packets requested.
  This command starts a stream of data packets. The list of packets requested is sent every 15 ms, which
  is the rate Roomba uses to update data.
  This method of requesting sensor data is best if you are controlling Roomba over a wireless network
  (which has poor real-time characteristics) with software running on a desktop computer.
   Serial sequence: [148] [Number of packets] [Packet ID 1] [Packet ID 2] [Packet ID 3] etc.
   Available in modes: Passive, Safe, or Full
   Changes mode to: No Change
  The format of the data returned is:
[19][N-bytes][Packet ID 1][Packet 1 data…][Packet ID 2][Packet 2 data…][Checksum]
N-bytes is the number of bytes between the n-bytes byte and the checksum.
The checksum is a 1-byte value. It is the 8-bit complement of all of the bytes in the packet, excluding
the checksum itself. That is, if you add all of the bytes in the packet, including the checksum, the low
byte of the result will be 0.
Example:
To get data from Roomba's left cliff signal (packet 29) and virtual wall sensor (packet 13), send the
following command string to Roomba:
[148] [2] [29] [13]
NOTE:
The left cliff signal is a 2-byte packet and the virtual wall is a 1-byte packet.
Roomba starts streaming data that looks like this:
 19 5 29 2 25 13 0 163
header n-bytes packet ID 1 Packet data 1 (2 bytes) packet ID 2 packet data 2 (1 byte) Checksum
NOTE:
Checksum computation: (19 + 5 + 29 + 2 + 25 + 13 + 0 + 163) = 256 and (256 & 0xFF) = 0.
In the above stream segment, Roomba’s left cliff signal value was 549 (0x0225) and there was no virtual
wall signal.
It is up to you not to request more data than can be sent at the current baud rate in the 15 ms time slot.
For example, at 115200 baud, a maximum of 172 bytes can be sent in 15 ms:
15 ms / 10 bits (8 data + start + stop) * 115200 = 172.8
If more data is requested, the data stream will eventually become corrupted. This can be confirmed by
checking the checksum.
The header byte and checksum can be used to align your receiving program with the data. All data
chunks start with 19 and end with the 1-byte checksum.

 * Roomba Open Interface Sensor Packets
 * Roomba sends back one of 58 different sensor data packets, depending on the
 * value of the packet data byte, when responding to a Sensors command, Query
 * List command, or Stream command’s request for a packet of sensor data bytes.
 * Some packets contain groups of other packets. Some of the sensor data values
 * are 16 bit values.
 * Most of the packets (numbers 7 – 58) contain the value of a single sensor or
 * variable, which can be either 1 byte or 2 bytes. Two byte packets correspond
 * to 16-bit values, sent high byte first.
 * Some of the packets (0-6, 100-107) contain groups of the single-value
 * packets.
