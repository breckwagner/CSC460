Derived from original library by Peter Fleury

Interrupt U\+A\+R\+T library using the built-\/in U\+A\+R\+T with transmit and receive circular buffers.

An interrupt is generated when the U\+A\+R\+T has finished transmitting or receiving a byte. The interrupt handling routines use circular buffers for buffering received and transmitted data.

\subsection*{Setting up}

The {\ttfamily U\+A\+R\+T\+\_\+\+R\+Xn\+\_\+\+B\+U\+F\+F\+E\+R\+\_\+\+S\+I\+Z\+E} and {\ttfamily U\+A\+R\+T\+\_\+\+T\+Xn\+\_\+\+B\+U\+F\+F\+E\+R\+\_\+\+S\+I\+Z\+E} constants define the size of the circular buffers in bytes. Note that these constants must be a power of 2. You may need to adapt this constants to your target and your application by adding to your compiler options\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-DUART_RXn_BUFFER_SIZE=nn -DUART_TXn_BUFFER_SIZE=nn
\end{DoxyVerb}


{\ttfamily R\+Xn} and {\ttfamily T\+Xn} refer to U\+A\+R\+T number, for U\+A\+R\+T3 with 128 byte buffers, add\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-DUART_RX3_BUFFER_SIZE=128 -DUART_TX3_BUFFER_SIZE=128
\end{DoxyVerb}


U\+A\+R\+T0 is always enabled by default, to enable the other available U\+A\+R\+Ts, add the following to your compiler options (or symbol options), for the relevant U\+S\+A\+R\+T number\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-DUSART1_ENABLED -DUSART2_ENABLED -DUSART3_ENABLED
\end{DoxyVerb}


To enable large buffer support (over 256 bytes, up to 2$^\wedge$16 bytes) use\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}-DUSARTn_LARGE_BUFFER
\end{DoxyVerb}


Where n = U\+S\+A\+R\+T number.

Supports A\+V\+R devices with up to 4 hardware U\+S\+A\+R\+Ts.

\subsection*{Notes}

\subsubsection*{Buffer overflow behaviour}

When the R\+X circular buffer is full, and it receives further data from the U\+A\+R\+T, a buffer overflow condition occurs. Any new data is dropped. The R\+X buffer must be read before any more incoming data from the U\+A\+R\+T is placed into the R\+X buffer.

If the T\+X buffer is full, and new data is sent to it using one of the {\ttfamily uart\+N\+\_\+put$\ast$()} functions, this function will loop and wait until the buffer is not full any more. It is important to make sure you have not disabled your U\+A\+R\+T transmit interrupts ({\ttfamily T\+X\+E\+N$\ast$}) elsewhere in your application (e.\+g with {\ttfamily cli()}) before calling the {\ttfamily uart\+N\+\_\+put$\ast$()} functions, as the application will lock up. The U\+A\+R\+T interrupts are automatically enabled when you use the {\ttfamily uart\+N\+\_\+init()} functions. This is probably not the idea behaviour, I\textquotesingle{}ll probably fix this some time.

For now, make sure {\ttfamily T\+X\+E\+N$\ast$} interrupts are enabled when calling {\ttfamily uart\+N\+\_\+put$\ast$()} functions. This should not be an issue unless you have code elsewhere purposely turning it off.
