<h2>* Laser Tank Game<br>
</h2>


<div style="text-align: justify; width: 860px;">The final project theme
for this term is to ultimately create two groups of laser-firing tanks,
each of which is implemented by a <span style="font-weight: bold;">remote-controlled semi-autonomous</span> Roomba robot.
Essentially, it is similar to this <a href="tanks/tanks.html" target="_blank">final project</a> (and <a href="tanks/tanks.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>), designed and implemented by Michael Krazanowski during the summer of 2010. <br>
<br>
Our tank game is played by 4 Roomba robots; each is designed and
implemented by a team of two students. Two teams play against two
teams. Each Roomba robot is <span style="font-weight: bold;">semi-autonomous</span>,
i.e., it can roam and seek target on its own and at same time avoid any
obstacle in its path. A human operator is also allowed to <span style="font-weight: bold;">remotely-control</span> the motion of the robot and trigger its laser.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: red;">To keep the game easy to compete, each Roomba </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">must roam</span><span style="color: red;"> for 30 seconds and then </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">must remain stationary</span><span style="color: red;">
for 30 seconds. The Roomba is allowed to spin, no faster than 6 degree
per second, thus maximum 180 degree in 30 seconds. While roaming, there
are no rotation or speed limit.</span><br>
<br>
On top of each Roomba, there is also a light-sensing target. When it is
being hit, the Roomba loses its motion capability, thus remains
stationary until the game is over.<br>
<br><span style="color: red;">Within a 10 minute period, the group with the most </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">mobile</span><span style="color: red;"> Roombas wins!</span><br>

<h2>* Requirements</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Each team consists of two students, who are responsible to assemble,
develop, design, test, measure, evaluate, document both software,
hardware, and their interfacing, in this final project. Every team <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> use an RTOS (developed in project 2) in their
implemented code. <br>
<br>
There are two phases in this project:<br>
<ol>
  <li>In phase 1, every team must demonstrate a working remotely-controlled Roomba with the ability to roam and shoot a target.</li>
  <li>In phase 2, semi-autonomous behaviours must be added to complete
the final design, thus the Roomba is able to roam and avoid obstacles
on its own.</li>
</ol>

<h2>* Grading and Report</h2>
Your project will be evaluated as follows. You only need submit a
combined final report on or before the deadline. Evaluation of phase 1
is done on or before the first milestone. Class-related exercises must
be completed in class and submitted to Connex; they will be evaluated
together with the combined final report.<br>
<br>
Phase 1: System Design (15%)<br>
Phase 1: Demonstration (15%)<br>
Phase 2: System Design (15%)<br>Phase 2: Demonstration (15%)<br>
Report: Phase 1 and 2 Combined With Additional Testing&nbsp; (40%)<br>
<br>
The combined report should fully describe the problem and your solution
for each part of the project.&nbsp; It should be detailed enough that
future students who read it can understand the project and learn from
what you've discovered.&nbsp; You should use diagrams, screenshots, and
photographs to illustrate concepts when possible, including system
block diagrams, wiring diagrams, logic analyzer screenshots, photos of
what you build, etc.&nbsp; Documenting your failures as well as
successes in your report is a good way for others to learn from.<br>
<br>
The report should be submitted as a PDF, HTML file, or a link to a website.<br>
