Instructions
Please read the schematics of DFRobot LCD shield on how the buttons are connected to the Arduino board. They are wired into the A/D port. This exercise is about understanding the A/D feature of AVR family of microcontrollers.

Use the DFRobot LCD module to test different sampling frequency (from 2Hz to as fast as possible) on the keypad inputs. Display your key inputs, number of registered inputs, and sampling frequency on the LCD. What is the lowest sampling frequency that still guarantees "good" results, i.e., minimum errors. (Note: If you don't get any errors, then something in the code is "filtering" the bouncing behaviour for you.)

An error is defined by either a "missing" or "erroneous" key input. Try counting number of key presses yourself in your head and observe what is being registered by your software. Do as fast as you can and see whether error rates increase.

This A/D interface to key inputs is similar to your PS/2 joystick. Read the actual library code and make sure that you understand how the A/D interface on the ATMEL chip works.

Submit your working code, screen-captured of the LCD and your findings in the submission box.
