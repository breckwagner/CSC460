Instructions
NO ARDUINO LIBRARY CODE IS ALLOWED!

This exercise is about learning how to implement context-switching in AVR.

Download a copy of "Shared Library Approach to RTOS Design" from the folder
"Resources/RTOS Sample Code". This piece of code doesn't work on ATMega2560,
due to "17-bit" address problem. Please read the report by Mike Krazanowsk.

If you don't understand the concept of context-switching, please read this
online report on Context Switching on AVR by Nitin Goyal and Rayhan Rahman.

Modify "shared.zip" so that it works. Create two tasks so that they can
context-switch back and forth voluntarily; when one yields, the other runs,
and so forth. Now, add your solution from Exercise 6 (i.e., a timer interrupt
handler) into your code, so that the tasks switch involuntarily, once every
10 mSec (100 Hz). This will be a rudimentary round-robin scheduler.

Submit your C code and observations in the submission box.
