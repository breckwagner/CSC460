<h1>CSC 460/560 Project 2<br>
</h1>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Due date</span>: Friday, 4 March 2015<span style="color: red;"></span><br>

<br>

<h2>* Objective</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">In project 2 you will learn how to
implement and test a simple&nbsp; priority-based preemptive
multithreading RTOS with features similar to the well-established
"pthread" library, including mutexes, timeouts, and priority inheritance. Our RTOS API is given by this <a href="os.h">os.h</a> file. The rest of this document explains the semantics of the API functions.<br><br>
</div>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<h2>* Task Preemption,&nbsp; Suspension and Sleeping<br>
</h2>

<ol>

</ol>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Any parameterless C function can be
created as a task with a fixed priority, from 0 (highest) to 15
(lowest). Every task has a unique process id (PID). When a task is
created (i.e., <span style="font-weight: bold;">Task_Create</span>()),
it enters the ready state. The currently running task will always be
the highest priority ready task. When the function associated with a
task returns, the task terminates; therefore, a perpetual task should
always execute an infinite loop after initialization.<br>
<br>
A task can be given an initial integer parameter at creation time. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Task_GetArg</span>()
will return its initial parameter. A task is usually given a small
stack to hold its context, local variables and function call
parameters. For small embedded systems such as ours (e.g., 8KB RAM on
ATMega2560), the task workspace is only 256 bytes! So, don't allocate
too many or too large local variables inside a task function, and never
use recursion!<br>
<br>
Tasks with <span style="font-style: italic;">equal</span> priority are executed <span style="font-style: italic;">cooperatively</span>, i.e., one must yield voluntarily in order for other equal priority tasks to run. They are executed in a <span style="font-style: italic;">first-come-first-served</span> basis. When a task yields (i.e., Task_Yield()), it re-enters as a newly ready task.<br>
<br>
A task may be suspended (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Task_Suspend</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">pid</span>))
any time. A suspended task is allowed to change states except become
running. For example, it can become the owner of a mutex lock, or wake
up from sleep, etc. But, it is not allowed to run until it is resumed (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Task_Resume</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">pid</span>)). Resuming a task which is not suspended has no effect.<br>
<br>
A task may put itself to sleep for a <span style="font-style: italic;">minimum</span> number of ticks (a clock tick is defined to be 10 milliseconds currently). When a task is waken up after <span style="font-weight: bold;">Task_Sleep</span>( <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span> ), this task has been delayed for<span style="font-weight: bold;"> at least</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span> clock ticks; it may sleep more than t ticks due to scheduling latency caused by other higher priority tasks.<br>
<br>
A task may kill itself (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Task_Terminate</span>()).
Task termination is <span style="font-style: italic;">immediate</span>; all resources allocated to this task
will be recovered and reused by other task. For example, a terminated
task will unlock all its mutexes that it owns, or will be removed from
the sleeping queue, mutex waiting queue, etc. When the function associated with a task returns, the task terminates.<br>
<br>

<h2>* Mutexes and Priority Inheritance<br>
</h2>


<div style="text-align: justify;">A <span style="font-weight: bold;">mutex</span> is a binary semaphore with the additional features of <span style="font-weight: bold;">ownership</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">recursiveness</span> and priority <span style="font-weight: bold;">inheritance</span>. A mutex is <span style="font-style: italic;">unlocked</span> initially. That is:<br>

<ul>
<li>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">ownership</span>) When a task locks a mutex, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mutex_Lock</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">m</span>), it becomes the <span style="font-style: italic;">owner</span> of the mutex; only the owner is allowed to unlock, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mutex_Unlock</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">m</span>), it;  <br>
  </li><li>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">recursiveness</span>) a mutex may be locked or unlocked <span style="font-style: italic;">mulitple</span> times by its owner; and</li><li>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">inheritance</span>) the owner, <span style="font-style: italic;">while holding the mutex lock</span>, will be allowed to run at the <span style="font-style: italic;">highest</span> priority level of one of its waiting tasks.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

Priority inheritance is <span style="font-style: italic;">immediate</span>, as soon as a higher priority task is waiting for locked mutex. The owner is resumed to its <span style="font-style: italic;">original</span> priority when it releases the mutex, i.e., no longer the owner. <br>
<br>
A task becomes <span style="font-style: italic;">blocked</span> if it calls <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mutex_Lock</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">m</span>) when <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span> is already locked. Tasks waiting for a mutex are resumed in a <span style="font-style: italic;">first-come-first-served</span> basis, i.e., there should be <span style="font-style: italic;">no barging</span>.<br>
<br>
A task may attempt to lock a mutex without waiting using <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mutex_TryLock</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">m</span>). If <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span> is locked, then <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mutex_TryLock</span>() returns 0 and the calling task continues; otherwise, it returns 1 and <span style="font-style: italic;">m </span>becomes locked and the calling task becomes the new owner.<br>
<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">


<h2>* Events and Hardware Interrupts<br>
</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In any real time systems, hardware interrupts are <span style="font-style: italic;">asynchronous</span>
events that trigger immediate responses. Without an RTOS, typically,
all hardware related interrupt processing is done in the interrupt
service routines (ISRs).&nbsp; ISR is generally <span style="font-style: italic;">not interruptible</span>.
It is a bad idea to allow nested interrupt processing because
castrophic failure may occur when faulty hardware generates spurious
interrupts.<br>
<br>
To reduce the overall interrupt latency, an ISR should be short and
handle only hardware level handshake (e.g., clearing interrupt status)
immediately. Any prolonged processing (e.g., time of day calculation)
should be handled at the task-level, i.e., scheduled by the RTOS.<br>
<br>
Thus, a "bottom-half" interrupt handling task is allowed to wait for an event (i.e., <span style="font-weight: bold;">Event_Wait</span>()),
which is an abstraction of a hardware interrupt. When an interrupt
occurs, the "top-half" interrupt processing is completed inside the
ISR. The waiting task will then be waken by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Event_Signal</span>(), which could be invoked by an ISR or by another task.<br>
<br>
An event is a <span style="font-style: italic;">blocking</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">consumable</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">idempotent</span> resource, with the following properties:<br>
<ul>
  <li>at most <span style="font-style: italic;">one</span> task is allowed to wait on any event;</li>
  <li>when an event is signalled, it wakes up a waiting task if there is one, otherwise it is recorded;</li>
  <li>(idempotent) only <span style="font-style: italic;">one</span> outstanding signal on an event is recorded, hence any subsequent signals on the same event will be lost;</li>
  <li>(consumable) a calling task of&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Event_Wait</span>() continues <span style="font-style: italic;">immediately</span> if the event has occurred (i.e., <span style="font-weight: bold;">Event_Signal</span>() has been recorded), as a result the event is cleared;</li>
  <li>(blocking) an event is cleared <span style="font-style: italic;">initially</span>; any task calling <span style="font-weight: bold;">Event_Wait</span>() will be <span style="font-style: italic;">blocked</span> if there is no outstanding signal on that event.</li>
</ul>
Calling <span style="font-weight: bold;">Event_Wait</span>() on an event which has already a waiting task is a no-op.<br>
<br>

<h2>* RTOS Booting and Context-Switching<br>

</h2>



<div style="text-align: justify;">Context-switching is one of the most <span style="font-style: italic;">complex</span>
piece of code of any RTOS (or OS). It is the mechanism that makes
multithreading/multitasking possible. Without the support of virtual
memory and sophisticated memory management, embedded RTOS
context-switching is a lot simpler than a typical desktop OS.<br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>

Context-switching is inherently <span style="font-style: italic;">processor-dependent</span>, thus must be written in the native <span style="font-style: italic;">assembly language</span>. In addition, it must follow the compiler convention of how a call-stack-frame is initializaed.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cooperative</span> multithreading using a library such as "pthread" is simpler because it doesn't require the use of a <span style="font-style: italic;">timer interrupt</span> (or any hardware interrupt) to trigger context-switching. With <span style="font-weight: bold;">preemptive</span> multithreading, one must consider how interrupts can cause context-switching which is <span style="font-style: italic;">involuntary</span>.<br>

<br>

In a typically desktop OS, the kernel is always in charge when a system
is booted. That is, the kernel is the first piece of code to be started
by the bootloader. When an RTOS, such as ours, to be built, we often
include both the kernel and the user application code together in a
single piece of binary image. There is a single "main()" to be called
upon booting (i.e., crt.s, the C-runtime start-up code). Is main()
inside the kernel? Or inside the user application code?<br>

<br>

Either will work as long as we are consistent. For our RTOS, we will use the following convention:<br>

</div>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>the crt.s (C-runtime) will be modified to call <span style="font-weight: bold;">OS_Init</span>() (not <span style="font-weight: bold;">main</span>()) at boot time;</li><li>upon the completion of <span style="font-weight: bold;">OS_Init</span>(), the kernel will create <span style="font-weight: bold;">main</span>() as the first highest priority task to be scheduled;</li><li>when the <span style="font-weight: bold;">main</span>() is executed, it will be allowed to initialize the application and then create all other application level tasks;</li><li>upon completion, <span style="font-weight: bold;">main</span>() can terminate, or remain as a member of the application tasks.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Pay attention to the <span style="font-style: italic;">17-bit address problem</span> when porting the context-switching code from ATMega1280 to ATMega2560.)<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"></div>
<h2>* Errors and Exceptions<br>
</h2>



<div style="text-align: justify;">There will always be misuse and abuse
of any RTOS API. Some will generate recoverables errors, and some are
unrecoverable. In most cases, recoverable errors will produce an error
message and the application continues. For unrecoverable errors, the
RTOS can produce an error message and then abort-and-restart or
abort-and-hang.<br>
<br>
For example, the following errors are <span style="font-style: italic;">recoverable</span>:<br>
<ul>
  <li>creating one more than MAXTHREAD is a no-op; <br>
  </li>
  <li>initializing one more than MAXMUTEX is a no-op;</li>
  <li>suspending, resuming or killing a task that doesn't exist;</li>
  <li>locking or unlocking a mutex that doesn't exist.</li>
</ul>
For example, the following errors are <span style="font-style: italic;">unrecoverable</span>:<br>
<ul>
  <li>a task used more stack space than WORKSPACE bytes;</li>
  <li>deadlocks caused by locking two mutexes in the wrong order.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
</div>




<h2>* Testing and Profiling<br>
</h2>


<div style="text-align: justify;">You are required to test your own RTOS that at least cover the cases:<br>
<ul>
  <li>task termination, suspending/resumption, and sleeping<br>
  </li>
  <li>mutex and priority inheritance<br>
  </li>
</ul>That is, you must convine us that your implementation meets the
properties and functionalities specified in this document. You must
explain how you test, what is expected and actual outcomes.<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"></div>

project 2.&nbsp; As in project 1, your report should define the
problems you are solving and provide clear and concise descriptions of
your solutions, with diagrams and tables to show concepts and data when
appropriate.&nbsp; Please read the sample past projects as sample submissions.<br>
<br>
The reader should be able to understand what you did
and why you did it well enough to reproduce your work.&nbsp; Your grade
will be broken down as follows:<br>
</div>



<ul>

  <li style="text-align: justify;">Booting and context-switching (5%)</li>
  <li>Priority-based Scheduling (5%)</li>
